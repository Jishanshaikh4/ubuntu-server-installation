\maketitle

\begin{abstract}\textbf{Abstract:} Stable Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) is released in first quarter of May 2018, with Long Term Support (LTS) for first time by Canonical on desktop, server, and cloud services. It is evident that more than 98\% of servers/clouds/supercomputers have deployed in Linux. There are not ground breaking changes in Ubuntu from 17.10 to 18.04 version, both of which are now also available with GNOME Shell (with a vision to move completely to GNOME environment). Ubuntu 18.04 for servers/clouds comes with NO absolute warranty, See licensing details \href{http://canonical.com/}{here}. This paper gives a brief overview on how to install/deploy Oracle 18.04 server on Oracle Virtual Box in Linux (Ubuntu). This document may be treated as third party manual. Ubuntu, Virtual Box, etc. are registered trademarks of their respective owners e.g. Canonical, Oracle.
